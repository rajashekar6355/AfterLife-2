        <h2>From Strangers to Innovators</h2>
    <p>In our first semester at Audencia Business School, Nantes, I (Austin) met Anjali and Logesh. We are three Indian students from different backgrounds, initially strangers. Anjali is the organized one, always on top of things, while I am the laid-back backbencher who relies on her for updates on classes and deadlines because the school’s online portal is a nightmare to navigate.<br> <br>
        This inconvenience sparked an idea. As I am getting familiarized  with voice assistants like ChatGPT, I began to envision a solution that could streamline these everyday hassles. The tipping point came when Anjali fell ill before the finance exam. And I was left to sift through countless emails and web pages to gather the necessary information, leading to a eureka moment: there had to be a better way<br><br>
        Realizing this was a widespread problem, Austin discussed the idea with Logesh. Together, they decided to create a virtual assistant tailored to the needs of students, one that could simplify access to information and improve the overall academic experience.<br><br>
        Our search for technical expertise led us to Ashrith and DhanushVardhan from NIT Trichy, who shared our enthusiasm and vision. With their technical prowess and our practical insights, we embarked on a journey to develop a robust virtual assistant for educational institutions.<br><br>
        Today, we are proud to announce our readiness to equip 1,000 schools with our innovative solution by June 2025. Our virtual assistant is designed to transform the student experience, making it more efficient, convenient, and enjoyable.<br><br>
        Welcome to our journey—where classroom frustrations fuel transformative innovation, and where a shared vision turns into a reality that benefits thousands.</p>
